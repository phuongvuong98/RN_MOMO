# Installation

This package is pre-installed in [managed](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/managed-vs-bare/) Expo projects. You may skip the rest of the installation guide if this applies to you.

For bare React Native projects, you must ensure that you have [installed and configured the `react-native-unimodules` package](https://github.com/unimodules/react-native-unimodules) before continuing.

### Add the package to your npm dependencies

```
npm install expo-intent-launcher
```

### Configure for iOS

This package does not make sense on iOS as there is no equivalent API, so it is not supported.

### Configure for Android

No additional set up necessary.
